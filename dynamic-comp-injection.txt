Steps for Dynamic components:
-----------------------------------
1. create a component  ( DynamicComponent)
2. create a service to configure component to inject and load
    (ServiceLoader)
3. Load ComponentFactoryResolver from Core library
    to dynamically resolve and create component instance
4. Inject ComponentFactoryResolver and ViewContainerRef
    (ViewContainerRef is pointer to Shadow DOM)
5. Set ViewContainerRef as rootContainer in a method 
6. Create the instance of DynamicComponent using
    ComponentFactoryResolver and Inject the component
7. Insert the dynamically created component with hostView

8. To consume wherever required(AppComponent) 
    Inject the service and call addDynamicComponent()
9. Configure ServiceLoader in Provider section of AppModule
10. add DynamicComponent in EntryComponent section
    declaration section to allow component to be injected
    at run time for security.
